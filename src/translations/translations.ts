            Hello and welcome to my portfolio page!
            <br />
            My name is Matija, and I am a passionate software developer with 2 years of experience in the industry.
            <br />
            <br />
            Before becoming a developer, I spent 7 years in sales, which helped me develop excellent communication and problem-solving skills.
            Throughout my career as a developer, I have worked on various projects, from small web applications to large-scale enterprise systems. I
            have extensive experience working with TypeScript, React, .NET, Umbraco, JavaScript, and Vue, and I like to think of myself as a
            jack-of-all-trades developer (but let&apos;s be honest, I&apos;m more like a master of some and a novice of others).
            <br />
            <br />
            One of my strengths as a software developer is my ability to analyze problems and provide innovative solutions. I enjoy working
            collaboratively with my team members to create software that is not only efficient but also user-friendly. I am also committed to writing
            clean, maintainable, and well-documented code (because let&apos;s face it, no one wants to inherit a mess of spaghetti code). In addition
            to my technical skills, I like to think I have a pretty good sense of humor (but I&apos;ll let you be the judge of that). When I&apos;m
            not coding, you can usually find me watching funny cat videos on YouTube or cracking terrible puns (I apologize in advance).
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio page. If you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential project (or share
            your favorite cat video), please feel free to contact me. I would be happy to chat with you!
